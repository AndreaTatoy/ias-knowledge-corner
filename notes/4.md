# **Cloud & Virtualization Fundamentals**

## **Virtualization and Hypervisors**

Virtualization allows a single physical machine (the host) to run multiple isolated operating systems (guests).

* **What is a Hypervisor?** It's the essential piece of software that creates and runs the virtual machines (VMs). It manages the hardware resources (CPU, RAM, storage) and allocates them to the VMs.

| Hypervisor Type | Description | Key Characteristic | Security Implication |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Type 1** | **Native or Bare-Metal.** Runs directly on the physical hardware. | Highly efficient; used in corporate data centers. | More secure because it has a smaller attack surface and less dependencies. |
| **Type 2** | **Hosted.** Runs as a regular application on top of an existing operating system (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Workstation). | Easier for personal use or testing (like running Kali Linux on Windows). | Less secure for production as it relies on the host OS's security. |

## **Cloud Storage and Deployment**

Cloud storage provides space on remote servers via the internet.

### **Cloud Deployment Models**

These define *who* manages the infrastructure and *where* it lives:

| Model | Description | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Public Cloud** | Services provided by a third-party vendor over the public internet (e.g., AWS, Azure). | Cost-effective, scalable, shared infrastructure. |
| **Private Cloud** | Resources used exclusively by one organization. Can be on-site or managed by a vendor. | Highest security and control, but also highest cost. |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | A mix of public and private clouds, allowing data/apps to move between the two. | Flexibility to host sensitive data privately while using the public cloud for non-sensitive data and scalability. |

### **Cloud Storage Applications**

The slides highlighted these key uses:

* **File Synchronization:** Services like Google Drive or Dropbox.  
* **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** Networks of distributed servers used to deliver content (like images, videos, or scripts) to users quickly by serving it from the location closest to them.

## **Cloud Security (CASB)**

* **CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker):** A security enforcement point that sits between cloud users and cloud service providers.  
* **What it does:** It provides visibility into cloud use, enforces security policies, and acts as a central control point.  
* **Key Benefits:**  
  * Enforces access controls and authorizations.  
  * Enables Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication.  
  * Scans for malware and monitors user activity.  
  * Reduces the risk of data theft across multiple cloud services.
