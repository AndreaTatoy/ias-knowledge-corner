# **Career Opportunities in IT Security**

## **The State of the Field**

* **What is Cybersecurity?** It's the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and sensitive data from theft, damage, or unauthorized access. It’s a field focused on protection and risk mitigation.  
* **High Demand:** The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects massive growth (33% from 2023 to 2033\) for information security analysts, showing high demand and competitive salaries.  
* **Flexible Work:** Many roles in cybersecurity offer remote work and flexible schedules, making it an attractive career path.

## **Red Team vs. Blue Team**

Cybersecurity roles are often divided into offensive and defensive sides:

### **Red Team (Offensive Security)**

* **Goal:** To **simulate real-world cyberattacks** and breach an organization's defenses *before* actual threat actors do.  
* **Mindset:** “Hack things before the bad guys do.”  
* **Primary Activity:** Penetration Testing and exploiting vulnerabilities.

### **Blue Team (Defensive Security)**

* **Goal:** To **improve security gaps** by monitoring networks, implementing security measures (like firewalls), and responding to incidents.  
* **Mindset:** “Improve security gaps before adversaries find them.”  
* **Primary Activity:** Security Monitoring, Incident Response, and system hardening.

## **The Security Operations Center (SOC) Structure**

The Blue Team often works within a SOC, which is typically structured into tiers to handle incidents efficiently:

| Tier | Role | Responsibility |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Tier 1** | Alert Analyst | The frontline. Monitors security tools, triages alerts, and determines if an incident is legitimate. |
| **Tier 2** | Incident Responder | Investigates confirmed incidents, contains the breach, and performs detailed analysis. |
| **Tier 3** | SME / Hunter | Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and Threat Hunters. Perform proactive hunting and in-depth analysis (e.g., Malware Reverse Engineering, Threat Intelligence). |
| **Management** | SOC Manager | Oversees the entire operation, manages resources, and communicates with senior leadership. |

## **Scanning vs. Testing**

It's important to understand the difference between passively finding weaknesses and actively exploiting them:

| Concept | Definition | Primary Action |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Vulnerability Scanning** | A systematic, automated review of security weaknesses using tools to check for known vulnerability signatures. | **Identify** known weaknesses (usually passive). |
| **Penetration Testing** | A simulated cyberattack against a system to check for *exploitable* vulnerabilities. | **Actively Exploit** weaknesses to confirm if they are genuine and determine system impact. |
