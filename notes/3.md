# **Encryption Fundamentals**

## **Principles of Cryptography**

Cryptography ensures the security of data in transit and at rest by fulfilling four main goals:

1. **Encryption (Confidentiality):** Hiding the data content. Transforming readable **plaintext** into unreadable **ciphertext** using an algorithm and a key.  
2. **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of the user or system (e.g., verifying a user's password or a server's certificate).  
3. **Integrity:** Ensuring that data has not been modified or tampered with since it was created or sent (often achieved with hashing).  
4. **Non-repudiation:** Proving that a specific user sent a message or performed an action and cannot later deny it (often achieved with digital signatures).

## **Core Cryptographic Tools**

| Tool | Purpose | Primary Use |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Ciphers** | The algorithms used for encryption and decryption. | Securing data to maintain Confidentiality. |
| **Hash Functions** | One-way functions that create a unique, fixed-length digest (checksum) of data. | Verifying data Integrity and storing passwords safely. |
| **Key Exchange Algorithms** | Methods (like Diffie-Hellman) that allow two parties to securely establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel. | Setting up secure communication for ciphers. |

## **Types of Encryption in Practice**

* **Transport Encryption (TLS/SSL):** Protects data *while it travels* between your browser and the web server (e.g., HTTPS). The communication is decrypted on the server.  
* **End-to-End (E2E) Encryption:** Protects data from the moment it leaves the sender until it reaches the recipient. No intermediary (not even the service provider) can read the content.

## **Digital Certificates (X.509)**

* **What they are:** Digital files that verify the ownership of a public key. They are essential for establishing trust on the internet (HTTPS).  
* **Certificate Authority (CA):** A trusted third party (like Sectigo or DigiCert) that issues, manages, and revokes digital certificates.  
* **Trusted Root-CAs:** The top level of trust. Their certificates are pre-installed in your browser and operating system, allowing them to vouch for all the CAs below them.  
* **CSR (Certificate Signing Request):** The process required to get a certificate. You generate this request, which contains your public key and information, and send it to the CA for validation and signing.
