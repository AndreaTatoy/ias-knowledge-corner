# **Email Security Fundamentals**

## **What is Email Security?**

* **Definition:** Electronic mail (email) is a method of transmitting and receiving digital messages using electronic devices over a computer network.
* **Goal:** To protect the core security pillars of email communication:
    * **Confidentiality:** Ensures only authorized users can access the email content.
    * **Integrity:** Protects emails from unauthorized modification or tampering.
    * **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of the sender.
    * **Non-repudiation:** Prevents senders from denying they sent an email.
    * **Availability:** Ensures email is accessible when needed.

### **The Email Delivery Process (How Email Works)**

The process involves multiple servers to successfully deliver a message:
1.  **Compose Letter (Email Client):** The user writes the email in their email client.
2.  **Post Office (SMTP Server):** The email client sends the message to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server.
3.  **Address Lookup (DNS Server):** The SMTP server checks the address by querying the Domain Name System (DNS) server.
4.  **Destination Post Office (MX Server):** The email is routed to the recipient's local Mail Exchange (MX) server.
5.  **Recipient's Mailbox (User Inbox):** The message is finally delivered to the recipient's mailbox.

## **Common Threats and Vulnerabilities**

* **Phishing:** Deceptive emails used to trick users into giving up sensitive information.
* **Spear Phishing:** Targeted phishing that uses personalized information to deceive specific individuals.
* **Email Spoofing:** Forging email headers to make a message appear as if it came from a trusted source.
* **Business Email Compromise (BEC):** Compromising or impersonating email accounts to initiate financial fraud.
* **Malware:** Malicious software delivered via email attachments or links.

## **Mitigation and Analysis Tools**

### **1. Email Encryption (The Primary Defense)**

* **How it Works:** Encryption scrambles the email content.
* **Result:** Only the intended recipient can read it. It protects sensitive information while the data is in transit and at rest.

### **2. Key Analysis Tools**

| Tool | Function | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Message Header Analyzer** | Parses and analyzes complex email headers. | Converts confusing text into an easy-to-read, structured view, and instantly shows authentication results (SPF, DKIM, DMARC). |
| **REMnux Platform** | A Linux toolkit specifically designed for malware analysis. | Contains essential open-source tools for analyzing malicious artifacts, such as `emldump` (parses EML files) and `msg-extractor` (extracts emails/attachments from MSG files). |
