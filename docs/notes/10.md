# **Introduction to Event Logs**

## **What are Event Logs?**

*  **Definition:** An event log is a record of any significant action or occurrence that is recognized by a software system and recorded in a special file.
*  **The Digital Footprint:** Logs record system events for an important audit trail.
*  **The Goal:** Logs help diagnose issues and investigate unauthorized activity.  They are the essential audit trail for identifying malicious activity.

### **Log Fundamentals and Correlation**

*  **Correlation:** The true power of logs comes from combining and cross-referencing different events to reconstruct an entire attack chain (e.g., from initial RDP brute force compromise to lateral movement and ransomware deployment).
*  **Log Entry Essential Information:** Each event log entry contains several key elements:
    *  **Level:** Severity or type of event (e.g., Error, Warning, Information).
    *  **Date and Time:** Precise time the event was logged.
    *  **Source:** Software or component logging the event (e.g., PowerShell).
    *  **Event ID:** A predefined numerical value for a specific operation or event.

## **Common Log Types**

 Specific log types offer a unique perspective on a system's operation and security:
*  **Security Logs:** Crucial for investigating attempted or successful unauthorized activities like logons/logoffs.
*  **System Logs:** Contain messages about operating system operations, such as startup, shutdown, and hardware changes.
*  **Application Logs:** Contain messages about specific application crashes or unusual behavior.
*  **Web Server Logs:** Record requests processed by a web server.

## **Log Access and Management**

*  **SIEM Systems:** Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems ingest and correlate logs for enterprise threat detection.
*  **Windows Log Access Tools:** Windows Event Logs act as the operating system's flight recorder.  Tools to access and query them effectively include:
    *  **Event Viewer:** A Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool for quick log analysis and filtering.
    *  **Wevtutil.exe:** A command-line tool for log management and scripting.
    *  **Get-WinEvent:** A powerful PowerShell cmdlet for filtering event logs.
