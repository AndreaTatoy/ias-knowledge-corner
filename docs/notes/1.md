# **The Importance of IT Security**

Essential takeaways from the “Introduction to IT Security” lesson:

## **The Big Picture: Why We Do This**

* **Information Assurance (IA) Defined:** IA is the practice of protecting information and managing the risks associated with its use, processing, storage, and transmission. It ensures the integrity, availability, authenticity, non-repudiation, and confidentiality of user data.  
* **Real-World Stakes:** Security is vital because data leaks (like the reported Wendy's Philippines breach) directly expose sensitive customer and employee information. Protection is necessary for trust, privacy, and legal compliance.

## **The CIA Triad: The Foundation of Security**

Every security effort aims to achieve these three goals:

### **1\. Confidentiality (Keeping Secrets Secret)**

* **Goal:** Information should only be seen by authorized individuals.  
* **Examples:** Personal medical records, financial statements, hashed passwords.  
* **Key Controls:** Encryption, strong authentication, and access control lists.

### **2\. Integrity (Keeping Information Honest)**

* **Goal:** Information must be consistent, trustworthy, and accurate. It should not be improperly modified.  
* **Examples:** Bank transactions, document editing, and database management.  
* **Key Controls:** Data validation, hashing/checksums, and version control systems.

### **3\. Availability (Keeping Systems Running)**

* **Goal:** Authorized users must be able to access the information and systems when needed, even during failures.  
* **Examples:** Healthcare systems, online shopping websites, cloud services.  
* **Key Controls:** Backups, redundancy (load balancers), and Denial of Service (DDoS) Protection.

## **Initial Access: The First Step of an Attack**

* **The Threat:** Before an attacker can exploit a vulnerability or steal data, they need a way to gain initial access.  
* **Primary Method:** The slides highlight **Phishing**—tricking a legitimate user into giving up credentials—as a common and effective technique used by threat actors to begin a compromise.
